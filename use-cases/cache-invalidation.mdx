## Overview

Use FlowWarden in **`ALL_INSTANCES`** deployment mode to broadcast cache invalidation events to every running instance of your application.

    A[(MongoDB)] -->|Change Stream| B[FlowWarden]
    B --> C[Instance 1 — evict cache]
    B --> D[Instance 2 — evict cache]
    B --> E[Instance N — evict cache]
```

## Why FlowWarden

- **`ALL_INSTANCES` mode** ensures every node receives the event
- **Sub-second latency** — no polling, no TTL guessing
- **`@Filter`** to react only to updates on cacheable collections
