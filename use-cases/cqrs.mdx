## Overview

Use FlowWarden to maintain **read-model projections** in a CQRS architecture. Write to your command collection; FlowWarden listens to Change Streams and updates denormalized read views in real time.

    A[Command Service] -->|write| B[(Orders collection)]
    B -->|Change Stream| C[FlowWarden]
    C -->|project| D[(OrderSummary view)]
    E[Query Service] -->|read| D
```

## Why FlowWarden

- **Checkpointing** ensures no event is lost between restarts
- **Retry + DLQ** handles transient projection failures
- **Filtering** lets you react only to relevant operation types
